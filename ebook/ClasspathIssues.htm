<p>Classpath and command-line operations</p>
<p>There are a variety of issues that can arise when configuring your computer. 
One of those issues has to do with the classpath environment variable.</p>
<p>For the past 23+ years, I have required students to access a multimedia 
library in conjunction with their assignments. This required them to compile and 
execute their programs in a specific manner, which prevented a common classpath 
problem from occurring. This semester, I have eliminated the multimedia library 
requirement which, in turn has allowed that classpath problem to occur on some, 
but not all student's computers.</p>
<p>Before reading further in this announcement, please go to
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html">
Path and Classpath</a>, scroll down to the section titled Checking the CLASSPATH 
variable (All platforms) and start reading from there. When you finish reading 
that section, go to and read the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html">
Setting the Class Path</a> technical note. You can stop reading when you reach 
the section titled Class Path Wild Cards.</p>
<p>While you may find some of the details of this reading material to be 
somewhat confusing, once you finish the reading, you should have some idea of 
what a classpath is and what it does.</p>
<p>Bottom line: The CLASSPATH variable is one way to tell applications, including the JDK tools, where to look for user classes. 
There are at least three ways to specify the classpath:</p>
<p>1. The preferred way to specify the class path is by using the -cp command line switch. This allows the CLASSPATH to be set individually for each application without affecting other applications.
 </p>
<p>2. A second way, when using a batch file to compile and run an application is 
to insert a command such as the following at the beginning of the batch file:</p>
<p>SET CLASSPATH=".;"</p>
<p>3. A third way is to set the CLASSPATH in</p>

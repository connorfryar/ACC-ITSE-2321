<h1><a name="Welcome">Welcome</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the eBook for Prof. Baldwin's online version of ITSE 2321 at Austin&nbsp;Community College. 
The contents of this eBook plus various online resources form the textbook for 
the class.</p>
<p>This course, and this eBook were designed according to the standards of <a href="https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric">
The Quality Matters Higher Education Rubric Sixth Edition</a>. As such, the 
course and the eBook were designed around properly aligned Course Level Objectives (CLOs), Module Level Objectives (MLOs), 
and Learning Activities (LAs). The alignment among these elements is shown in a 
course map that is provided in your Blackboard course for ITSE 2321.</p>
<p>The course and the eBook are structured with two CLOs, about a dozen MLOs, 
and many LAs.</p>
<h1><a name="Learning_Resources">Learning resources</a></h1>
<p>The two most important learning resources for this course are this eBook, which you can download from the course menu on the left side of your Blackboard page, and the online eBook, 
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html">Introduction to Computer Science using Java</a>, July 2019, by Bradley Kjell, Central Connecticut State University.</p>
<p>You will find many references to the Kjell eBook in this eBook, and you 
should consider them to be as important as the material in the eBook. In addition to providing good 
explanations for many Java programming concepts, the Kjell eBook contains 
numerous quizzes, reviews, exercises, and flash cards. I strongly recommend that 
you study that material in addition to this eBook to help you learn about 
Object-Oriented Programming using Java.</p>
<h2><a name="How_to_use_this_eBook">How to use this eBook</a></h2>
<p>The most straightforward way to use this eBook is to open the Table of 
Contents in file named <strong>index.htm</strong> in your browser and study the chapters in order from top to bottom. 
You should do that. Assume, however, that after studying many of the chapters in 
the eBook, you realize that you would like to go back and re-study those chapters 
that contain the word "concatenate". You need a way to identify those 
chapters without having to do a manual search.</p>
<h3><a name="Searching_for_keywords">Searching for keywords</a></h3>
<p>There is an easy way to identify those chapters on a Windows system and 
presumably on other systems as well. Open the folder containing the files that 
make up the eBook and enter the word "concatenate" in the search box, typically in 
the upper right corner of the explorer window. When the search is completed, you 
should see a list of about sixteen files that contain the word concatenate.</p>
<p>Now assume that you want to identify the first chapter in the eBook that 
contains the word concatenate. Compare the names of the files in the list with the names of 
the links in the Table of Contents and you will see the first chapter that 
contains the word concatenate is the chapter in the file named Jb0160.htm. 
Select that file in the Table of Contents and use your browser search capability 
to search for the word.</p>
<p>Maybe that didn't provide the information that you were looking for. A second 
comparison will show that the next chapter containing the word concatenate is 
the chapter in the file named Jb0210.htm. Open that file and you will find an 
explanation of String concatenation.</p>
<h3><a name="The_Appendix">The Appendix</a></h3>
<p>The eBook also contains an Appendix with about fifteen chapters to be used as 
optional supplemental study material. Each chapter contains several short 
programs with questions about the programs, answers to the questions, and 
explanations of the answers. Because the Appendix is intended to be used as 
optional supplemental study material, no attempt was made to specifically 
align the material in the Appendix with the MLOs. However, the order of the 
chapters in the Appendix is generally aligned with the order of the chapters in the MLOs.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to make use of the Appendix to enhance their learning 
experience.</p>
<h2><a name="How_to_use_the_Kjell_eBook">How to use the Kjell eBook</a></h2>
<p>The most straightforward way to use the
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/index.html">Kjell eBook</a> is to 
open the eBook and study the material interactively from top to bottom making 
sure that you take advantage of the interactive Quizzes, Flash Cards, Reviews, 
and Exercises along the way.</p>
<h3><a name="The_alphabetical_index">The alphabetical index</a></h3>
<p>The Kjell eBook has an extensive alphabetical index at the 
bottom of the main page. For example, you could use that index to find and study 
a discussion of
<a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap08/ch08_15.html#boolean">boolean</a>. </p>
<p>However, while the index is extensive. it is not all inclusive. For example, 
it doesn't contain the word concatenate or any variation of that word.</p>
<h3><a name="An_online_Google_search">An online Google search</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately there is another approach to finding discussions of various keywords and 
topics with the Kjell eBook. For example, do a Google search for the 
following:</p>
<pre>site:http://programmedlessons.org/Java9 concatenate</pre>
<p>As of 06/07/22, that search will return links to five pages on that site 
that have to do with concatenation.</p>
<p>If you perform a Google search on the following</p>
<pre>site:http://programmedlessons.org/Java9 boolean</pre>
<p>you will have access to the same page as when using the 
alphabetical index alone.</p>
<p>I recommend that while reading this eBook you keep a browser Google search window 
open to</p>
<pre>site:http://programmedlessons.org/Java9 xxx</pre>
<p>Whenever you come upon a word or term that you don't understand, such as 
"method overloading" for example, you substitute that term for XXX and re-open 
the browser to that new location. In many cases, that will lead you to a Kjell 
discussion of the term.</p>
<h3><a name="Specific_references">Specific page references</a></h3>
<p>Throughout this eBook you will see references to specific Kjell pages such as 
the following: <em>(see Kjell <a href="http://programmedlessons.org/Java9/chap46/ch46_09.html#method_definition,_syntax">
Method Definition</a>)). </em>When you follow one of those links to a specific 
page in the Kjell eBook, in addition to studying the material on that page, it 
will be a good idea to use the arrow buttons to access and study the material on 
the previous page and the next page, or possibly the next several pages.</p>

<h1><a name="Deprecated_classes">Deprecated elements</a></h1>
<p>In the world of software development, "deprecated" refers to functions or elements that are in the process of being replaced by newer ones. 
As time goes on, when you compile the sample program in this eBook, you may find 
that they use elements that have been deprecated by Oracle. For example, as of 
07/27/21, if you are using Java SE-16 and you compile a program that 
instantiates an object of the <strong>Integer</strong> class, you will get a compiler warning similar to the following:</p>
<pre>Proj09Runner.java:27: warning: [removal] Integer(int) in 
Integer has been deprecated and marked for removal
              new Integer(++cnt);
              ^</pre>
<p>Note that this is a <em>warning</em> and not an <em>error</em>. While the program that produced 
the above warning will compile and run successfully under Java SE-16, it can be 
expected that it will no longer compile under some later version of Java.</p>
<p>Insofar as this course is concerned, the use of deprecated elements in 
assignment code is not a 
problem as long as the program containing the deprecated element will still 
compile and run under the latest released version of Java SE.</p>
<p>If you encounter a deprecated element warning when compiling the sample programs in 
this eBook, it will be worth&nbsp;your while to visit the Java documentation 
and learn how to avoid the warning. For example, the eBook chapter titled "Jb0200: Variables" shows how 
to deal with a deprecated version of the <strong>Double</strong> class.</p>
<p>If you encounter a deprecated element in a sample program in this eBook that 
will no longer compile under the latest released version of Java SE, please let 
me know so that I can update the sample program in the eBook.</p>
<p>Click
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/deprecated-list.html">
here</a> to see a list 
of deprecated elements in 
Java SE-16, including the older constructors for the <strong>Double</strong> and <strong>Integer</strong> classes. This list contains hints 
showing "improved" or alternative ways of accomplishing the objectives of the deprecated 
elements.</p>
